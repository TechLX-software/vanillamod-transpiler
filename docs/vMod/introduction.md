### What is vMod?

**vMod** is the open source library that powers the [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) website. **vMod** translates JavaScript into Minecraft commands (like `/gamemode creative`). The result is the practicality of a real programming language, while leveraging the features and compatibility of Minecraftâ€™s built in features. **vMod** only works for Minecraft Java Edition.

### What is vanillamod.com?

[**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) is the website we (TechLX) built to help teach programming and game design. On the website, you can save mods to your account and learn with free and paid courses. But, it's also powerful enough for true map-making, with new features added frequently.

## What can I do with vMod?

Stuff - (Create games for vanilla MC, Learn JS, Learn game development)

Check out what others have made on the [Examples page](examples.md).

## Why should I use vMod?

Stuff - (As a Student, Educator, Game Developer / Map Maker.) (Learn JS, online courses and documentation, Convenience and power of real code syntax; no installs or configuraton, just add the MC world to your saves; helpful editor checks for command errors; performance optimization and analyzer)

The [Editor page](editor.md) has a more detailed explanation of many helpful features. 

## How does vMod work?

When you download your mod, vMod first translates each of line of code you write into a special coding language used by Minecraft. Then, that translated code is turned into the file you download and use in your world. Because of this translation, anything you make with vMod works seamlessly in Minecraft. Your friends can play with your vMod creations together in multiplayer or in a downloaded world, all without any installation or configuration.

Still curious?

### How vMod works, in three ways

More detailed explanations, broken down for different kinds of experience.

When vMod translates your code, the special coding language used by Minecraft is actually long lists of [Minecraft commands](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands). You may have used Minecraft commands before, like `/gamemode creative` or `/summon creeper`. These long lists of Minecraft commands are called [`mcfunction`](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Function_(Java_Edition))s, and a group of `mcfunction`s make up something called a [datapack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack). The file you download from vMod and add to your world is a datapack, and Minecraft uses that datapack to makes your creation work. Because the datapack is inside your world, you can just send your world to your friends and they can [download it like any adventure map](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Map_downloads#Download_a_world).

vMod follows a process similar to a [source-to-source compiler or "transpiler"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler). It transpiles source code from one language (JS) into the source code of another language (the Minecraft scripting language). However, the Minecraft scripting language does not natively have features like variables, iterative loops, and memory management, so vMod also does some of the work of a full compiler by implementing them. 

Each step of the vMod transpiling process is described in detail on the [Transpiler page](transpiler.md).

## What is this documentation for?

This documentation describes the features of the **vMod** library and the code editor on [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/). It is primarily a reference for writing JavaScript using the **vMod** library.
