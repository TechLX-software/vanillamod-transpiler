## Before you continue!

The best way to get started with VanillaMod is the "Intro to Modding (with Minecraft)" online course on [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/). Sign in, go to the courses page, then click "Enroll".

The online course is well-paced, interactive, and fun. __Everyone should start with the online course because it provides the most detailed and thorough experience.__ This "Quick Start" will be confusing if you're not comfortable with programming and Minecraft.

Feel free to look around, but all examples and videos are copied from the online course. This guide leaves out most of the explanations for brevity. If you just want to see cool stuff people have made with VanillaMod, the [Examples page](examples.md) is the best place to look.

## Quick Start Guide

:::caution
This quick start guide is meant for people who are familiar with programming and basic Minecraft map making. Whether or not you familiar with both of those things, this guide is objectively way less cool than the Intro to Modding online course. 
:::

This guide covers several small examples to demonstrate the basics of what vMod can do. These examples are taken from the "Intro to Modding (with Minecraft)" online course on [**vanillamod.com**], but with most of the explanations removed based on the assumption that you can understand code and interpret what happens in Minecraft.
