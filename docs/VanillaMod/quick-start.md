## Try the Intro to Modding Course!

The best way to get started with VanillaMod is the "Intro to Modding (with Minecraft)" online course on [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/). Sign in, go to the courses page, find the Intro to Modding course, then click "Enroll."

**Everyone should start with the online course because it's interactive and fun**. This "Quick Start" is more of a reference than a tutorial, and it will be confusing if you're not comfortable with programming and Minecraft. If you want to see cool stuff made with VanillaMod, the [Examples page](examples) is the best place to look.

## Quick Start Guide

:::caution
This quick start guide is meant for people who are familiar with programming and basic Minecraft map making. Whether or not you are familiar with both of those things, this guide is objectively way less cool than the Intro to Modding online course. 
:::

This guide covers several small examples to demonstrate the basics of what vMod can do. These examples are taken from the "Intro to Modding (with Minecraft)" online course on [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/), but with most of the explanations removed based on the assumption that you can understand code and interpret what happens in Minecraft.
