# vMod

**vMod** is the open source library behind the [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) website. **vMod** translates JavaScript into Minecraft commands (like `/gamemode creative`). The result is the practicality of a real programming language, while leveraging the features and compatibility of Minecraftâ€™s built in features. **vMod** only works for Minecraft Java Edition.

This repository holds the [documentation](https://meta.vanillamod.com/docs/), transpiler, and code editor used on the [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) website.

## What does vMod do?

This is best illustrated with an example. Here is some JavaScript:

```javascript
function countdown() {
  console.log("Initiating countdown sequence!")
  for (let counter = 10; counter > 0; counter--) {
    console.log(counter, "seconds remaining")
  }
  console.log("Liftoff!")
}
```

vMod will parse this JavaScript code and turn it into a datapack with several `.mcfunction` files. These are the files that would be generated by the above code, with comments describing where each line comes from.

#### The body of `countdown()`

```mcfunction 
# File path - ./PACK_NAME/data/v_mod_playground/functions/countdown/main.mcfunction

# First console.log
tellraw @p ["","Initiating countdown sequence!"," "]
# Initialize the "counter" variable
function v_mod_playground:countdown/line0005_for-loop/init
# Check the for loop condition
execute store success score @s vMod_LastSuccess if score @e[tag=vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7,limit=1] vMod_Variable matches 1..
# If the condition passes, run the body of the for loop
execute if entity @s[scores={vMod_LastSuccess=1..}] run function v_mod_playground:countdown/line0005_for-loop/body
# Delete the variable "counter" created by the for loop
kill @e[tag=v_mod_playground.countdown.line0005_for-loop-depth-1]
# Last console.log
tellraw @p ["","Liftoff!"," "]
```

#### Initializing the variable `counter`

```mcfunction
# File path - ./PACK_NAME/data/v_mod_playground/functions/countdown/line0005_for-loop/init.mcfunction

# Create an entity to hold the value of "counter"
summon minecraft:area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"\"int-counter\"",NoGravity:1b,Duration:2147483647,Tags:["vMod-v_mod_playground","v_mod_playground.countdown.line0005_for-loop-depth-1","vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7"]}
# Set "counter" to 10
scoreboard players set @e[tag=vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7] vMod_Variable 10
```

#### The body of the for loop

```mcfunction
# File path - ./PACK_NAME/data/v_mod_playground/functions/countdown/line0005_for-loop/body.mcfunction

# Log the value of "counter" followed by the string "seconds remaining"
tellraw @p ["",{"score":{"name":"@e[tag=vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7]","objective":"vMod_Variable"}}," ","seconds remaining"," "]
# Subtract 1 from the value of "counter" (as specified in the for loop)
scoreboard players remove @e[tag=vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7] vMod_Variable 1
# Check the for loop condition
execute store success score @s vMod_LastSuccess if score @e[tag=vMod-v_mod_playground-var-counter-line-5-column-7,limit=1] vMod_Variable matches 1..
# If the condition passes, run the body of the for loop
execute if entity @s[scores={vMod_LastSuccess=1..}] run function v_mod_playground:countdown/line0005_for-loop/body
```
