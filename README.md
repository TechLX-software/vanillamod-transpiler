# vMod

**vMod** is the open source library behind the [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) website. **vMod** translates JavaScript into Minecraft commands (like `/gamemode creative`). The result is the practicality of a real programming language, while leveraging the features and compatibility of Minecraftâ€™s built in features. **vMod** only works for Minecraft Java Edition.

This repository holds the [documentation](https://meta.vanillamod.com/docs/), transpiler, and code editor used on the [**vanillamod.com**](https://www.vanillamod.com/) website.

Download the repo then

```console
yarn install
yarn start
```

`yarn install` downloads the required packages, and `yarn start` initiates a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
